Installation
Ensure you have Python and the package manager pip installed. Run the following command to access the Kaggle API
using the command line: pip install kaggle

Authentication
If you are using the Kaggle CLI tool, the tool will look for this token at ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json on Linux and OSX,
and at C:\Users\<Windows-username>\.kaggle\kaggle.json on Windows. If the token is not there, an error will be raised.
Hence, once you’ve downloaded the token, you should move it from your Downloads folder to this folder.

If you are using the Kaggle API directly, where you keep the token doesn’t matter, so long as you are able to provide
your credentials at runtime.
